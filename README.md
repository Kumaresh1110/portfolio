### Education
Masters in Computer Science

### Work Experience
### Programmer - Applied Philosophy of Science.

As part of a comprehensive NLP project, I led the development of an environment in Google Colab, utilizing pre-trained transformer models to process and analyze textual data. The project centered on building Named Entity Recognition (NER) functionality with BERT and initial explorations in answer generation with GPT-2.
    
Project Highlights:
    
Google Colab Setup & Environment Configuration:
    
Installed essential libraries like transformers, torch, and datasets, preparing Colab for NLP processing.
Integrated Google Drive for easy dataset access and streamlined data handling.
   
Data Preparation & Preprocessing:
    
Loaded and preprocessed datasets using pandas and the datasets library, transforming raw CSV files into training-ready formats.
Assisted in data creation by structuring and organizing AP questions for model training.
    
BERT for Named Entity Recognition (NER):
    
 Implemented pre-trained BERT tokenizer and model for token classification tasks.
 Aligned tokenized inputs with their respective labels to ensure accurate and efficient entity extraction.
 Fine-tuned the BERT model, configuring training parameters using Hugging Face's Trainer module for optimal results.

 Code Notebook Development:
    
Created an end-to-end Python notebook in Google Colab, automating data preprocessing and BERT fine-tuning for efficient project execution.
    
Model Optimization:
    
Began with GPT-2 fine-tuning for answer generation, but transitioned to BERT for more task-specific accuracy in NER, demonstrating adaptability to project requirements.
    
Collaborative Efforts:
    
Engaged regularly with the team and professor, discussing model optimization, data creation, and overall project goals.
Integrated feedback into the project, ensuring alignment with both academic and technical objectives.

Key Technologies & Tools:
    
Libraries: transformers, torch, datasets, pandas.

Models: BERT (for NER), GPT-2 (for answer generation).
 
Tools: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Drive.
 
Impact: Improved accuracy of entity recognition tasks using fine-tuned BERT models, laying the groundwork for future NLP applications.
        Showcased the ability to adapt and fine-tune state-of-the-art models for specific text processing tasks.
        Gained invaluable hands-on experience in model training, data manipulation, and problem-solving in real-world scenarios.
